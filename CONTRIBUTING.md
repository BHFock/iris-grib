How to contribute
=================

We want Iris and its sister packages (such as iris-grib) to be driven by
the community - your contributions are invaluable to us! This page lists
the guidelines for contributors which will help ease the process of
getting your hard work accepted into iris-grib, and shared back to the world.

   [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free).
1. Fork the iris-grib repository, create your new fix/feature branch, and
   start commiting code.
 - The main
   [Iris development guide](http://scitools.org.uk/iris/docs/latest/developers_guide/gitwash/git_development.html)
   has more detail.
1. Remember to add appropriate documentation and tests to supplement any new or changed functionality.
